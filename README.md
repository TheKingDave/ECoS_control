# ECoS Control

A mobile phone hand controller for the [ECoS](http://www.esu.eu/en/products/digital-control/ecos-50210-dcc-system/what-ecos-can-do/) station.  
It is somewhat leaned on the [Mobile Control II](http://www.esu.eu/en/products/digital-control/mobile-control-ii/).  
I started the project before I knew about Mobile Control II.

### Test Mode
If you want to test the interface you can test it in the Testing/Debug mode.


Station name = debug  
Station port = 45227
